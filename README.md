# MATH-370-Writing-in-Mathematics
Taught by Andrew Havens at UMass Amherst Spring 2022.

While the mathematicians of the pre-internet age often spread their mathematical ideas within the community via written letters prior to publication, modern mathematical correspondence and exposition is rapidly facilitated by a variety of digital tools. Of great importance to the publishing process in mathematical sciences is the LaTeX markup language, used to typeset virtually all modern mathematical publications, even at the pre-print stage. In this course we will develop facility with LaTeX, and develop a variety of writing practices important to participation in the mathematical community. There will be regular written assignments completed in LaTeX, as well as collaborative writing assignments, owing to the importance of collaborative writing in mathematical research. Writing topics may include proofs, assignment creation, pre-professional writing (resumes/cover letters, research and teaching statements), expository writing for a general audience, recreational mathematics, and the history of mathematics. Short writing assignments on such topics will be assigned in response to assigned readings from a variety of accessible/provided sources. Towards the end of the semester groups will complete a research paper of an expository nature and craft a seminar style presentation.
